# Advent-of-Code
www.adventofcode.com provides small programming puzzles.

Each challenge had two parts, marked "a" or "b" in the names.

This problems seems to require some advanced algorithmic methods, which also requie further JAVA studies.
I plan to finish them as soon im done with the core modules of my code learning roadmap.
