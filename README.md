# Advent-of-Code
small programming puzzles from www.adventofcode.com


My solutions on the annual Advent-of_code challenge.
Each challenge had two part, marked 'a' or 'b' in the namings.

This problems seems to require some advanced algorithmic methods, what also requires my Java knowledge a little 
I plan to finish them as soon im done with the core modules of my code learning roadmap.
